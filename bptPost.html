		<h2 class="blogPostHead">5 New Reasons to Visit NYC This Summer!</h2>

		<p class="blogPost">	
			1. <span class="head">Free Wifi</span><br>
			Link NYC will be providing free high speed Wifi all over NYC. This will replace all pay phones (red dots) in the future. Make free phone calls to anywhere in the U.S. using their Vonage app while charging your phone at the USB port for free! At least 510 Links will be installed in the five boroughs by July 2016.<br>
			Currently installed:
			<br>
			14th St.
			<br>
			26th St. (there's 2 kiosks there!)
			<br>
			31st St. 
			<br>
			35th St.
			<br>
			<br>	
			2. <span class="head">International Food Market at Pier 57</span><br>
			Travel host Anthony Bourdain will be opening a International Food Market at Pier 57 on 15th and the Hudson River near Chelsea Food Market and the Google office. This place will feature a hawker style Asian Food Bazaar similar to the night markets in Asia. Estimated to open April 2016 (Edited: will now open 2017)<br>
			No word if there will be karaoke.
			<br>
			<br>
			3. <span class="head">Flushing, Queens</span><br>
			There's a street in Queens, NY that rivals most places in Manhattan. Main St on the last stop on the 7 train in Flushing, Queens is the third highest foot traffic place after Times Square and Grand Central. Known as the best place for Asian food in NYC, people willing to make the hike will be awarded with heavenly dumplings and hand pulled noodles. This is also where X'ian Famous Foods first started out.<br>
			How to get there: If you are uptown in Manhattan, it's probably easier for you to take the 7 line straight across to Queens. However if you are staying downtown, my favorite mode of transportation is taking one of those "sketchy" Chinatown vans from Confucius Plaza straight to Flushing Main St.
			<br>
			<br>
			4. <span class="head">Medical Marijuana</span><br>
			If you have the prescription for medical marijuana, NYC opened its first dispensary on 14th St in the East Village. Don' be surprised if more of these start popping up all over the city.
			<br>
			<br>
			5. <span class="head">New Music Festival - Panorama</span><br>
			From the producers of Coachella comes a new music festival which will take over Randall's Island over the summer.
